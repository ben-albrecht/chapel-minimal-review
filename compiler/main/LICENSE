"The Chapel implementation is composed of two categories of code:\n"
"\n"
"1) code that was specifically developed for, or contributed to, the\n"
"   Chapel project.  This code comprises the core of the Chapel\n"
"   implementation: the compiler, runtime, and standard/internal\n"
"   modules.  Code in this category is made available under the\n"
"   Apache v2.0 license, which can be found in 'LICENSE.chapel' in\n"

"\n"
"2) code from other open-source projects that we package and\n"
"   redistribute for the convenience of end-users.  Packages in this\n"
"   category are made available under the terms of their original\n"
"   licenses, respectively.\n"
"\n"
